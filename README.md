# 🧠 CognIQ – A Web-Based Scientific IQ Test

CognIQ is an open-source project aimed at creating a **scientifically grounded, web-based IQ test**. The goal is to provide a fair, reliable, and accessible platform for measuring cognitive abilities using validated psychometric principles.

---

## 📖 Overview

This project is designed to:
- Deliver an interactive IQ test via a modern web interface.
- Base assessments on **established psychometric models** (fluid intelligence, working memory, pattern recognition).
- Ensure **cultural fairness** by emphasizing non-verbal reasoning tasks.
- Provide **transparent documentation** of methodology, references, and design choices.

## 🧪 Scientific Basis

CognIQ is inspired by established psychometric frameworks:
- **Fluid Intelligence**: Problem-solving and abstract reasoning.
- **Working Memory**: Short-term retention and manipulation of information.
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying logical sequences and relationships.

All test items are designed to minimize cultural and language bias, focusing on **non-verbal reasoning tasks**.

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please read `docs/methodology.md` before submitting pull requests to ensure scientific integrity is maintained.

### Suggested Repo Name
- **cogniq** (short, memorable, blends “cognition” + “IQ”)  
- Alternative: **iq-test-web** (more descriptive, less brandable)

---

Would you like me to also draft the **methodology.md** file next, with a structured explanation of the psychometric principles and test design philosophy? That way, your repo will look academically solid right from the start.
